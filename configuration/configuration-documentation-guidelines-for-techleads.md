## Configuration Documentation Guidelines

- These are meant to guide techleads on how to add documentation for configuring Medic Mobile projects.

- These guidelines are to ensure that all documentation is up to date, easy to find, and not redundant.

- These guidelines are not meant to make the process of writing documentation more difficult, but to make the documentation more usable by all.

### 1. _table-of-contents

- The `_table-of-contents` provides easy navigation of all the documentation in the configuration folder.

- Whenever you want to add documentation, be sure to check the `_table-of-contents` to make sure that related documentation does not exist. If it does, update the existing document with the new information or preferably create a pull request (more on this to be discussed and agreed upon...)

- If the documentation you wish to add does not exist, add the documentation and create a pull request for the `_table-of-contents` adding the title of the new documentation with it's hyperlink.

### 2. Formatting 

- Always use GitHub markdown formatting and ensure you document is easy to read before adding it to the `_table-of-contents`

- You could use a GitHub Flavored markdown editor such as [this one](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) but always make sure you check your final document on GitHub.

- If you use Sublime text editor to create your markdown documents, it is recommended that you install a plugin that will enable you to preview your document in your web browser. [Markdown Preview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Preview) is one recommendation.

### 3. Images

- All images should be placed in the `img` folder.

- If necessary, create a subfolder within the `img` folder to add images for particular doc. For example if the the doc has very many images within it or if your docs exist within a subfolder in `configuration`.
