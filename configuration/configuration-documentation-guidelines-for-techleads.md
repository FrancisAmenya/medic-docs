- These are meant to guide techleads on how to add documentation for configuring Medic Mobile projects.

- These guidelines are to ensure that all documentation is up to date, easy to find, and not redundant.

- These guidelines are not meant to make the process of writing documentation more difficult, but to make the documentation more usable by all.

### 1. Basic details

- Add the author, created on, last edit by, and last edit on fields to each document you create.

- These details will help anyone using the documentation to know who to turn to incase further clarification on the documentation is needed.

- `Created date` and `Last edit on` fields will ensure it is easy to know how up to date the documentation is.

- It is true that this information is also possible to find on GitHub however this may prevent one from absent mindedly using outdated documentation and also gives a quick indication of the original author of the document without having to go to the revision history. 

- Furthmore non-technical users who may need to refer to the documentation will also be able to easily track how old the documentation is and who to refer to incase they need to seek clarification. 

### 2. _table-of-contents

- The `_table-of-contents` provides easy navigation of all the documentation in the configuration folder.

- Whenever you want to add documentation, be sure to check the `_table-of-contents` to make sure that related documentation does not exist. If it does, update the existing document with the new information or preferably create a pull request (more on this to be discussed and agreed upon...)

- If the documentation you wish to add does not exist, add the documentation and create a pull request for the `_table-of-contents` adding the title of the new documentation with it's hyperlink.

### 3. Formatting 

- Always use GitHub markdown formatting and ensure you document is easy to read before adding it to the `_table-of-contents`

- You could use a GitHub Flavored markdown editor such as [this one](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) but always make sure you check your final document on GitHub.

### 4. Images

- All images should be placed in the `img` folder.

- If necessary, create a subfolder within the `img` folder to add images for particular doc. For example if the the doc has very many images within it or if your docs exist within a subfolder in `configuration`.
