# App settings

Much of the configuration of the app is stored in the database in a document with id "settings". To update settings use the [medic-conf](https://github.com/medic/medic-conf) command line tool.

For more details on what you can use in settings, check out the [superset of supported settings](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/blob/master/config/standard/app_settings.json).

### Optional Settings

The following settings do not need to be specified. They should only be defined when the default implementation needs to be changed.

| Setting              | Description | Default | Version |
|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| phone_validation     | <ul><li>"full": full validation of a phone number for a region using length and prefix information.</li><li>"partial": quickly guesses whether a number is a possible phone number by using only the length information, much faster than a full validation.</li><li>"none": allows almost any values but still fails for any phone that contains a-z chars.</li></ul> | "full" | 3.1.0   |
| uhc.contacts_default_sort | <ul><li>"alpha": Sort contacts alphanumerically</li><li>"last_visited_date": sort contacts by the date they were most recently visited.</li></ul> | "alpha" | 2.18.0 |
| uhc.visit_count.month_start_date | The date of each month when the visit count is reset to 0. | 1 |2.18.0 |
| uhc.visit_count.visit_count_goal | The monthly visit count goal. | 0 | 2.18.0 |
| outgoing_deny_list | All outgoing messages will be denied (unsent) if the recipient phone number starts with an entry in this list. A comma delimited list. (eg. `outgoing_deny_list="253,ORANGE"` will deny all messages sent to `253 543 4448` and `ORANGE NET`) | "" | |
| outgoing_deny_shorter_than | Deny all messages to recipient phone numbers which are shorter than this value. Intended to avoid [message loops](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-quick-pointers.md#message-loops) with short codes used by gateways (eg. `60396`). An integer. | 6 | 3.2.0 |
| outgoing_deny_with_alphas | When `true`, deny all messages to recipient phone numbers containing letters (eg. `Safaricom`). Intended to avoid [message loops](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-quick-pointers.md#message-loops) with non-numeric senders used by gateways. A boolean. | true | 3.2.0 |

### Configuring SMS schedules

The Medic platform can have a set of predetermined messages set to be sent at a specificied times in future. These messages are usually
triggered by form submissions. To configure scheduled messages, the following declarations must be made in app_settings.json:

#### 1. Set up the scheduled messages

Scheduled messages are defined under the `schedules` key as an array of schedule objects. The definition takes the typical form below:

```
  "schedules": [
    {
      "name": "ANC Visit Reminders",
      "summary": "",
      "description": "",
      "start_from": "lmp_date",
      "messages": [
        {
          "translation_key": "messages.schedule.registration.followup_anc_pnc",
          "group": 1,
          "offset": "4 weeks",
          "send_day": "monday",
          "send_time": "09:00",
          "recipient": "reporting_unit"
        },
		.
		.
		.
		.
		more message definitions
      ]
    }
	.
	.
	.
	.
	more schedule definitions
]
```

|property|description|required|
|-------|---------|----------|
|`name`|A unique string label that is used to identify the schedule. Spaces are allowed.|yes|
|`summary`|Short description of the of the schedule.|no|
|`description`|A narrative for the schedule.|no|
|`start_from`|The base date from which the `messages[].offset` is added to determine when to send individual messages. You could specify any property on the report that contains a date value. The default is `reported_date`, which is when the report was submitted.|no|
|`messages`|Array of objects, each containing a message to send out and its properties.|yes|
|`messages[].translation_key`|The translation key of the message to send out. Available in 2.15+.|yes|
|`messages[].messages`| Array of message objects, each with `content` and `locale` properties. From 2.15 on use `translation_key` instead.|no|
|`messages[].group`|Integer identifier to group messages that belong together so that they can be cleared together as a group by future reports. For instance a series of messages announcing a visit, and following up for a missed visit could be grouped together and cleared by a single visit report. |yes|
|`messages[].offset`| Time interval from the `start_from` date for when the message should be sent. It is structured as a string with an integer value followed by a space and the time unit. For instance `8 weeks` or `2 days`. The units available are `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months`, `years`, and their singular forms as well. Note that although you can specify `seconds`, the accuracy of the sending time will be determined by delays in the processing the message on the server and on the gateway.|yes|
|`messages[].send_day`| String value of the day of the week on which the message should be sent. For instance, to send a message at the beginning of the week setting it to `"Monday"` will make sure the message goes out on the closest Monday _after_ the `start_date` + `offset`. `|no|
|`messages[].send_time`| Time of day that the message should be sent in 24 hour format.|no|
|`messages[].recipient`| Recipient of the message. It can be set to `reporting_unit` (sender of the form), 'clinic' (clinic that the sender of the form is attached to), 'parent' (parent of the sender of the form), or a specific phone number.|no|

#### 2. Set up schedule triggers

Under the registrations key in app_settings, we can setup triggers for scheduled messages. A trigger for the schedule above can be defined as shown below:

```

"registrations": [
{
      "form": "PR",
      "events": [
        {
          "name": "on_create",
          "trigger": "assign_schedule",
          "params": "ANC Visit Reminders",
          "bool_expr": "doc.fields.last_menstrual_period"
        }
      ],
      "validations": {},
      "messages": []
    }
]

```

|property|description|required|
|-------|---------|----------|
|`form`|Form ID that should trigger the schedule.|yes|
|`events`|An array of event object definitions of what should happen when this form is received.|yes|
|`event[].name`|Name of the event that has happened. The only supported event is `on_create` which happens when a form is received.|yes|
|`event[].trigger`|What should happen after the named event. `assign_schedule` will assign the schedule named in `params` to this report. The full set of trigger configuration directives are described [here](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/transitions.md#triggers).|yes|
|`event[].params`|Any useful information for the event. In our case, it holds the name of the schedule to be triggered.|no|
|`event[].bool_expr`|A JavaScript expression that will be cast to boolean to qualify execution of the event. Leaving blank will default to always true. CouchDB document fields can be accessed using `doc.key.subkey`. Regular expressions can be tested using `pattern.test(value)` e.g. /^[0-9]+$/.test(doc.fields.last_menstrual_period). In our example above, we're making sure the form has an LMP date.|no|
