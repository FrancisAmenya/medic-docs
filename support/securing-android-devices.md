# Securing Android devices

## PIN Setup and Disk Encryption

### Android 5.0 or later

Open the `Security` menu under settings. On unmodified versions of Android, this can be found under `Settings`
`>` `Personal` `>` `Security`. Choose `Encrypt Phone`, `Encrypt Tablet`, or `Encrypt Device`. If you haven't
already set a PIN or passcode for the lock screen, you will be prompted to do so.

### Android 4.4 or earlier

First, you'll need to set up a PIN. Navigate to `Settings` `>` `Security` `>` `Screen Lock`, and set a numeric PIN
for the device. Remember this PIN and do not write it down.

Then, open the `Security` menu under settings. On unmodified versions of Android, this can be found under
`Settings` `>` `Personal` `>` `Security`. Choose `Encrypt Phone` or `Encrypt Tablet`.

TODO: instructions on how to secure an android device:

 - disk encryption
 - pincode / password
 - remote wiping
 - possibly discuss scenarios, explain how our data is stored and what that means (ie we store data unencrypted, anyone who can access the phone can pull of PHI etc)
