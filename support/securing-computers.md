# Securing Computers

TODO: fill this in

 - How to encrypt a Windows computer
 - Same for Linux and MacOS (why not, they're easy)
 - How to password protect these computers
 - Possibly a discussion (either here or linked from [Securing Android devices](securing-android-devices.md)) on how data gets stored etc
